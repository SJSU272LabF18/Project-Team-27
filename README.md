### Approved Project Idea: Will It Sell? - Android App Success Predictor

Description: Ever made an app that got you pulling all-nighters for weeks, only to get the lowest possible ranking on the app store? Feels terrible, right? Next time you build an app, use this prediction system to assess the success of your app before you start banging away at your keyboard to get that app on the app store. Our prediction system applies sentiment analysis on the app description you provide and it provides you back with a detailed analysis of your app's potential selling quotient.

Methodology: Apply SVM on the Google App Store dataset based on attributes like high rating, good reviews, large number of downloads, and so on. When the user inputs their proposed app description, our system determines the probable outcome as success or failure and the detailed analysis.

Professor's Comment: I would also predict key metrics such as number of downloads by geography and age group etc..
