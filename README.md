### Project Idea 1: SalePoint - Best place to buy from during Black Friday

Every year during the Black Friday sale, a horde of people can be seen waiting to get their item of desire .People often get confused in selecting the best place to buy from for different articles. In all that hurry , they might miss a chance to buy their article as it runs out of stock. The model will take training data with previous year shopping figures so to decide what place is best according to the trend. After training the model, it should be able to predict the best store to buy anything at a reasonable price. When the user inputs an item he/she wants to purchase, it should be able to recommend stores based on previous figures.

Methodology: Sentiment analysis is done on older reviews to derive the places with best reviews on various products  

Data set: The project can be done be using datasets for example Kaggle datasets.

### Project Idea 2: Will It Sell? - Android App Success Predictor

Ever made an app that got you pulling all-nighters for weeks, only to get the lowest possible ranking on the app store? Sure feels terrible. Next time you build an app, use this prediction system to assess the success of your app before you start off with the development. Our prediction system applies sentiment analysis on the description you provide and provides you with a detailed analysis of your apps selling quotient.

Methodology: Apply SVM on the Google App Store dataset based on attributes like high rating, good reviews, large number of downloads, and so on. When the user searches for their proposed app description, our system determines the probable outcome as success or failure and the detailed analysis.

### Project Idea 3: TakeMeHome! - A Campus Ride Companion App
Attacks on students while traveling back home from campus are frequent. Being from different majors and having different lecture timings, it gets difficult for the students to travel in groups, even when they live on the same route. The app will help match them to other users AKA *travel companions*, any time of the day, based on their route. Before they choose to start off together, users would be able to assess the matched companion's credibility based on their ratings. As an added security measure, only users with an edu id will be able to sign up for the service. APIs of VTA-Transit/Uber/etc would be attached, for companions that use some mode of transport on their way.



### Project Idea 4: Gimme - A Food Sharing App
Leftovers can be a big problem. Post the details of your leftovers or the food that you bought but dont need, and you'll be surprised by the number of people that would happily take it. Share food for free or put your own price on it. Food sharers have to mention the expiry date of the food they're posting. Sharers get rated by the takers on the quality of shared food. Food is to be picked within a specified time.



### Project Idea 5: Sarcasm Detection
One of the most intriguing features of human discourse is Sarcasm. *"Alexa! Could you be any less audible?"* - your Alexa would have a hard time processing this statement. Statements rich in sarcasm or irony can only be detected mechanically when provided with context or by indentifying the overly positive or negative parts in any dialogue. Machine detection of such features is far from perfect, and there is a lot of scope for improvement in this area of Sentiment Analysis. The project aims to create a framework for efficient detection of sarcasm in feeds from Twitter, by the analysis of context and identification of double positives or negatives in the statements.
