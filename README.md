### Project Idea 1: TakeMeHome! - A Ride Companion App
**Project description:** Attacks on students while traveling back home from campus are frequent. Being from different majors and having different lecture timings, it gets difficult for the students to travel in groups, even when they live on the same route. The app will help match them to other users AKA *travel companions*, any time of the day, based on their route. Before they choose to start off together, users would be able to assess the matched companion's credibility based on their ratings. As an added security measure, only users with an edu id will be able to sign up for the service. APIs of VTA-Transit/Uber/etc would be attached, for companions that use some mode of convence on their way.

### Project Idea 2: Gimme - A Food Sharing App
**Project description:** Leftovers can be a big problem. Post the details of your leftovers or the food that you bought but dont need, and you'll be surprised by the number of people that would happily take it. Share food for free or put your own price on it. Food sharers have to mention the expiry date of the food they're posting. Sharers get rated by the takers on the quality of shared food. Food is to be picked within a specified time.
