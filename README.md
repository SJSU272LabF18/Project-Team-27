### Project Idea 1: Ride Companion
Project description: Ride companion is motivated by the frequent attacks on 
students from campus while traveling back home. Because of being from different 
majors and different lecture timings, it gets difficult for students of the same route to 
travel in groups so the app helps them find travel companions at any particular time 
of the day.

### Project Idea 2: Food Sharing
Project description: Share food to people who reply to your post for leftover food.
People get ratings for sharing food.Food has to be picked within the specified time.
It should be verified by person that food is actually good for eating and wont affect 
health of persn having it
