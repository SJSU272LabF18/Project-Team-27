### Project Idea 1: TakeMeHome! - A Ride Companion App
Attacks on students while traveling back home from campus are frequent. Being from different majors and having different lecture timings, it gets difficult for the students to travel in groups, even when they live on the same route. The app will help match them to other users AKA *travel companions*, any time of the day, based on their route. Before they choose to start off together, users would be able to assess the matched companion's credibility based on their ratings. As an added security measure, only users with an edu id will be able to sign up for the service. APIs of VTA-Transit/Uber/etc would be attached, for companions that use some mode of transport on their way.

### Project Idea 2: Gimme - A Food Sharing App
Leftovers can be a big problem. Post the details of your leftovers or the food that you bought but dont need, and you'll be surprised by the number of people that would happily take it. Share food for free or put your own price on it. Food sharers have to mention the expiry date of the food they're posting. Sharers get rated by the takers on the quality of shared food. Food is to be picked within a specified time.

### Project Idea 3: Sarcasm Detection
One of the most intriguing features of human discourse is Sarcasm. "Alexa! Could you be any less audible?" - your Alexa would have a hard time processing this statement. Statements rich in sarcasm or irony can only be detected mechanically, by providing context or by indentifying the overly positive or negative parts in any dialogue. Machine detection of such features is far from perfect, and there is a lot of scope for improvement in this area of Sentiment Analysis. The project aims to create a framework for efficient detection of sarcasm in feeds from Twitter, by the analysis of context and identification of double positives or negatives in the statements.
